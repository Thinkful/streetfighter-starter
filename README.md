Starter Files for FEWD jQuery Streetfighter Project
This assignment for the Thinkful front-end program had us develop our skills using the jQuery library.
The objective was to use interactive elements to produce a basic simulator of Ryu from Street Fighter throwing 
his famous HADOUKEN, and striking a pose on mouse/click commands.
